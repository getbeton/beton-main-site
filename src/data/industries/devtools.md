## Why DevTool Companies Need Revenue Intelligence

Developers adopt tools individually before organizations purchase them. This bottom-up adoption creates a unique challenge: by the time a developer asks for procurement, they've already made their decision. The key is identifying champions early and supporting their internal advocacy.

## How Beton Works for DevTools

Beton monitors developer engagement patterns — API usage, integration depth, documentation exploration — and identifies when individual usage is transitioning to team adoption, routing these signals to your sales team at the right moment.

## Common DevTool Signals

- Individual developer hitting API rate limits consistently
- Multiple developers from the same organization using the tool
- Production environment integration (vs. development/testing only)
- Advanced feature and API endpoint exploration
- Documentation deep-dives into enterprise features
