## Why SaaS Companies Need Revenue Intelligence

SaaS businesses generate enormous amounts of product usage data, but most of it never reaches the revenue team. Marketing qualified leads (MQLs) miss the product signals that actually predict buying behavior.

Beton bridges this gap by connecting your PostHog product analytics directly to your CRM, ensuring your sales and success teams always know which accounts need attention.

## How Beton Works for SaaS

1. **Connect** your PostHog instance to Beton
2. **Detect** behavioral signals that indicate buying intent, expansion readiness, or churn risk
3. **Route** signals to your CRM (Attio, HubSpot, Zoho, Pipedrive) for timely follow-up

## Common SaaS Signals

- Trial users completing core activation milestones
- Free users hitting feature gates on premium functionality
- Accounts adding seats or inviting team members
- Power users reducing login frequency or feature usage
- Customers approaching usage-based plan limits
