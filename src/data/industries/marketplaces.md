## Why Marketplaces Need Revenue Intelligence

Marketplaces live and die by participant activation and engagement. Identifying which sellers are becoming power sellers and which buyers are becoming high-value repeat customers enables targeted monetization and growth programs.

## How Beton Works for Marketplaces

Beton monitors both sides of your marketplace — seller activity, buyer engagement, transaction patterns — and identifies participants who are ready for premium tiers, additional services, or dedicated account management.

## Common Marketplace Signals

- Seller listing volume exceeding standard tier limits
- Buyer repeat purchase frequency increasing
- Transaction value growth indicating premium tier readiness
- Cross-category expansion by established participants
- API or bulk upload tool adoption by sellers
