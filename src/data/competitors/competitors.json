        "question": "Can Beton work alongside my existing lead scoring?",

        "question": "Why not just use HubSpot or Salesforce scoring?",
        "answer": "Built-in scoring is fine for basic demographic qualification. But if you have a product with user activity data, Beton can detect behavioral signals that predict conversion far better than static rules."
