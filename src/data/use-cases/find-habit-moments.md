## How It Works

Beton analyzes behavioral data from PostHog to find patterns that distinguish retained users from churned ones. It identifies specific actions, frequencies, and sequences that correlate with long-term engagement — then surfaces these insights so product and growth teams can act on them.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Repeated feature usage**: Users performing the same core action multiple times within a defined period
- **Workflow completion frequency**: Regular completion of end-to-end workflows indicating embedded usage
- **Session regularity**: Consistent return patterns (daily, weekly) that indicate habitual engagement
- **Feature stickiness**: High ratio of active usage days to total days since signup

## Results You Can Expect

Teams using Beton for habit moment detection gain clarity on which product actions matter most for retention. This enables targeted onboarding improvements, smarter feature prioritization, and early warning when users aren't building the habits that predict long-term engagement.
