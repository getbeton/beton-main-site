problem: "Onboarding drop-off is invisible without manual tracking. CS teams don't know which new users are progressing smoothly and which have stalled — until it's too late and the user has churned."
solution: "Beton monitors onboarding milestones from your product usage data and detects when users stall at any step. When a user falls behind expected onboarding timelines, Beton alerts the assigned CS rep in your CRM with context on where the user got stuck."
benefits:
  - "Detect stalled users before they churn during onboarding"
  - "Track onboarding milestone completion automatically"
  - "Alert CS reps with context on exactly where users are stuck"
  - "Measure time-to-first-value across your user base"

## How It Works

Beton tracks product usage events that correspond to onboarding milestones — account setup, first feature use, data import, team invite, integration connection. It builds a progress model for each new user and detects when someone falls behind expected timelines, automatically creating tasks or alerts in your CRM.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Setup step completion**: Tracking progress through account configuration steps
- **Time-to-first-value**: How long it takes each user to complete their first meaningful workflow
- **Activation rate**: Whether users reach key activation milestones within expected windows
- **Onboarding guide engagement**: Interaction with tooltips, guides, or setup wizards

## Results You Can Expect

CS teams using Beton for onboarding optimization get proactive visibility into which users need help. Instead of waiting for users to raise their hand or quietly disappear, teams intervene at the moment of friction — improving activation rates and reducing early-stage churn.
