## How It Works

Beton connects inbound lead data with product usage signals from PostHog. When a marketing-qualified lead also has trial or freemium activity, Beton enriches their CRM record with behavioral engagement data — feature exploration, activation progress, and usage patterns — giving sales reps a complete picture before they reach out.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Trial activation**: Whether the lead completed trial setup and started using the product
- **Feature exploration**: Depth of feature usage during trial or free tier
- **Pricing page visits**: Repeated visits to pricing pages indicating purchase consideration
- **Docs engagement**: Time spent in documentation, API references, or integration guides

## Results You Can Expect

Teams using Beton for inbound lead scoring see their sales reps spending more time on leads that actually convert. By enriching marketing signals with product engagement data, the scoring model better predicts which inbound leads are worth pursuing immediately.
