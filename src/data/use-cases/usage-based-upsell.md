## How It Works

Beton tracks usage metrics that correlate with plan limits — data volume, API calls, active seats, storage consumption — and alerts your sales team via CRM when customers are approaching thresholds that warrant a plan upgrade conversation.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Usage approaching limits**: 80%+ of plan allocation consumed
- **Overage patterns**: Repeated hits against rate limits or quotas
- **Growth trajectory**: Accelerating usage that will exceed limits soon
- **Feature lock-outs**: Users encountering tier-restricted functionality
- **Billing page visits**: Customers reviewing their usage and plan details

## Results You Can Expect

Revenue teams using Beton for usage-based upsells convert more expansion opportunities by reaching customers during the natural moment when they need more capacity.
