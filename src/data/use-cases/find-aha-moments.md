## How It Works

Beton connects to your PostHog data and identifies the behavioral milestones that correlate with conversion. By comparing the actions of users who converted against those who didn't, Beton pinpoints the specific moments of first value — then monitors every user's progress toward those milestones.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **First successful workflow**: User completes a core product workflow end-to-end for the first time
- **First integration connected**: User connects an external tool, deepening product investment
- **First data import**: User brings their own data into the product, signaling commitment
- **First team invite**: User shares the product with a colleague, indicating perceived value

## Results You Can Expect

Teams using Beton for aha moment detection can systematically optimize their activation funnel. By understanding exactly which actions predict conversion, product teams focus efforts on getting users to those moments faster — and sales teams know exactly when to engage.
