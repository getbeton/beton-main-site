## How It Works

Beton tracks trial user behavior in PostHog, building an engagement score based on feature adoption, session depth, and workflow completion. High-scoring trials are automatically flagged in your CRM with context about what they've been doing in the product.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Activation milestones**: Completing key setup steps within first 48 hours
- **Feature breadth**: Exploring multiple core features during trial
- **Return visits**: Consistent daily or multi-day engagement patterns
- **Data import**: Uploading real data instead of using sample datasets
- **Sharing activity**: Inviting colleagues or sharing outputs

## Results You Can Expect

Sales teams using Beton for trial qualification can prioritize outreach based on genuine product engagement, dramatically improving conversion conversations.
