problem: "Most lifecycle email campaigns use time-based triggers — send a welcome email on day 1, a nudge on day 3, a trial ending reminder on day 12. These ignore actual user behavior, sending the wrong message at the wrong time."
solution: "Beton detects behavioral lifecycle moments from product usage data and triggers campaigns at exactly the right time. A user who activated on day 1 gets a different sequence than one still exploring on day 5 — all driven by real behavior, not calendar logic."

## How It Works

Beton monitors product usage data from PostHog and detects lifecycle moments — trial activation, feature milestones, engagement drops, expansion readiness. When a behavioral trigger fires, Beton sends a signal via webhook or n8n to your email platform or marketing automation tool, triggering the appropriate campaign.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Trial-to-paid readiness**: User has activated key features and shows buying behavior patterns
- **Expansion readiness**: Existing customer hitting usage limits or exploring advanced features
- **Re-engagement needed**: Previously active user showing declining engagement
- **Milestone achieved**: User reaching a meaningful product milestone worth celebrating

## Results You Can Expect

Marketing teams using Beton for lifecycle automation see higher engagement and conversion from their campaigns. Behavioral triggers ensure users receive messages relevant to their actual product journey — not generic drip sequences that ignore where the user actually is.
