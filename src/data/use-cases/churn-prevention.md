## How It Works

Beton establishes baseline engagement patterns for each account, then monitors for deviations that indicate disengagement. When warning signals cross configurable thresholds, alerts are routed to your CRM for customer success follow-up.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Login decline**: Key users reducing login frequency over 2+ weeks
- **Feature abandonment**: Previously active features going unused
- **Reduced depth**: Users completing fewer workflows or steps
- **Support silence**: Accounts that previously engaged support going quiet
- **Champion departure**: Primary power users becoming inactive

## Results You Can Expect

Teams using Beton for churn prevention gain weeks of early warning, enabling proactive engagement that keeps customers onboard during critical periods.
