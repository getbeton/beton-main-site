## How It Works

Beton analyzes usage patterns across your customer base to find accounts that are outgrowing their current plan. When signals indicate expansion readiness, Beton creates tasks or updates records in your CRM so account managers can reach out proactively.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Seat ceiling**: Account approaching or hitting user seat limits
- **Feature gates**: Multiple users attempting to access premium features
- **Usage growth**: Significant increase in API calls, data volume, or sessions
- **Workflow complexity**: Teams creating more advanced configurations
- **Cross-team adoption**: New departments or teams within the same account

## Results You Can Expect

Revenue teams using Beton for expansion revenue get early visibility into which accounts are ready to grow, enabling proactive conversations instead of reactive renewals.
