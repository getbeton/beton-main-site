problem: "One-size-fits-all lead scoring assigns the same weight to every action, missing the nuance of real product engagement. A user who connected an API and invited their team scores the same as one who just browsed settings."

## How It Works

Beton analyzes product usage data from PostHog and assigns each user a behavioral score reflecting their engagement depth. Scores are based on multiple dimensions — feature breadth, usage velocity, collaboration signals, and integration activity — and update continuously as behavior changes. Scores sync to your CRM for pipeline prioritization.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Feature breadth**: Number and diversity of product features actively used
- **Usage velocity**: Rate of increase in product engagement over time
- **Collaboration signals**: Team invites, shared workspaces, and multi-user activity
- **Integration activity**: API connections, webhook setups, and third-party tool usage

## Results You Can Expect

Sales teams using Beton for PQL scoring report more efficient pipeline management — reps focus on the leads with the strongest engagement signals rather than working through lists sequentially. Higher-scored leads convert at significantly higher rates, validating the behavioral scoring approach.
