problem: "Customer success teams rely on calendar-based renewal outreach, contacting accounts at fixed intervals before their renewal date. This misses accounts whose engagement has been declining for months — and wastes time on healthy accounts that don't need attention."
solution: "Beton monitors product usage trends across your customer base and detects engagement decline patterns relative to renewal dates. When an account shows warning signs, Beton alerts your CS team in the CRM with time to intervene."
benefits:
  - "Detect renewal risk weeks or months before the renewal date"
  - "Prioritize CS outreach based on actual usage signals, not calendar dates"
  - "Reduce surprise churn at renewal by catching disengagement early"
  - "Route risk alerts to account owners in HubSpot, Attio, or Zoho"

## How It Works

Beton tracks product usage trends for each customer account and correlates them with renewal timelines. When usage patterns deviate from healthy baselines — declining logins, abandoned features, fewer active users — Beton creates alerts in your CRM so customer success managers can engage proactively.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Login decline approaching renewal**: Steady drop in login frequency in the weeks before a renewal date
- **Feature abandonment**: Previously active features going unused, suggesting reduced product reliance
- **Reduced active users**: Fewer team members engaging with the product within an account
- **Support ticket patterns**: Increase in support contacts or unresolved issues near renewal windows

## Results You Can Expect

Customer success teams using Beton for renewal management shift from reactive calendar-based outreach to proactive signal-driven engagement. At-risk accounts get attention when it matters most, leading to higher renewal rates and fewer last-minute surprises.
