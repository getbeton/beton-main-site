## How It Works

Beton connects to your PostHog instance and continuously monitors user behavior for conversion signals. When patterns emerge that match buying intent — such as inviting team members, exploring premium features, or hitting usage milestones — Beton automatically creates or updates records in your CRM.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Team expansion**: User invites 3+ colleagues within a week
- **Feature exploration**: Free user accesses premium feature gates multiple times
- **Usage velocity**: Daily active usage exceeds typical free-tier patterns
- **Integration setup**: User connects external tools or APIs
- **Admin activity**: User accesses billing or settings pages repeatedly

## Results You Can Expect

Teams using Beton for PLG conversion typically see a significant increase in free-to-paid conversion rates, primarily because sales reps engage prospects at the moment of highest intent rather than relying on calendar-based follow-ups.
