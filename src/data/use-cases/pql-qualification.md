## How It Works

Beton connects to your PostHog instance and continuously analyzes user behavior for patterns that indicate buying readiness. Instead of relying on manually defined PQL criteria, Beton's AI identifies the behavioral combinations that actually correlate with conversion — and updates its detection as patterns shift.

## Typical Signals Detected

- **Feature activation depth**: Users exploring multiple core features beyond initial setup
- **Team invites**: Individual users inviting colleagues, signaling organizational buy-in
- **API key creation**: Technical users integrating your product into their workflows
- **Integration setup**: Connecting third-party tools that deepen product dependency
- **Return visit patterns**: Consistent daily or weekly usage indicating habitual adoption

## Results You Can Expect

Teams using Beton for PQL qualification typically surface qualified leads days earlier than static rule-based approaches. Sales reps spend less time on unqualified leads and engage prospects when behavioral signals are strongest.
