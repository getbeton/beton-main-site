## Our Mission

We believe that product usage data is the most honest signal of customer intent. Not form fills, not email opens — actual product behavior. Beton exists to make these signals actionable for revenue teams.

## The Problem We Solve

Product-led growth companies generate massive amounts of product analytics data. But this data rarely reaches the people who need it most — sales teams, customer success managers, and revenue operations. The result is missed opportunities, reactive sales processes, and churn that could have been prevented.

## Our Approach

Beton connects your product analytics (PostHog) to your revenue tools (CRMs, webhooks, automation platforms). We detect behavioral signals that indicate buying intent, expansion readiness, or churn risk, and route them to the right people at the right time.

### What Makes Beton Different

- **Open source (GPL)**: Full transparency, full control. Self-host or use our cloud.
- **No data hoarding**: Beton reads your events and routes signals. We don't store your product data.
- **Behavioral signals, not lead scores**: Real product engagement patterns, not arbitrary point systems.
- **Multi-destination routing**: One signal to many tools simultaneously.

## The Company

Beton is built by a team of repeat founders and published ML researchers. We're a small, focused team building tools that bridge the gap between product analytics and revenue operations.

## Open Source

Beton is licensed under AGPLv3. We believe open-source infrastructure for revenue intelligence makes the ecosystem stronger. You can view, modify, and self-host the entire codebase. See more info in our [Github repo](https://github.com/getbeton/inspector).
