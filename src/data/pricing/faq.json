    "question": "Does Beton store my product data?",
    "answer": "No. Beton reads events from your PostHog instance and routes signals to your CRM. We don't store your granular product analytics data (e.g. particular events or groups of events) but we store results of aggregated analytics. Self-hosting is always available and free with your own LLM keys. If you want we can do an airgapped deployment – it comes with a silver hat.",
