# Beton

> Open-source revenue intelligence for product-led growth companies. Beton detects behavioral signals in product usage data and routes them to CRM and sales tools.

## What Beton Does

Beton connects product analytics (PostHog) to revenue tools (CRMs, webhooks, automation platforms). It detects patterns in product usage, deal history, billing, and support tickets that indicate buying intent, expansion readiness, or churn risk — then routes those signals to the right people at the right time.

Key differentiators:
- Open source (AGPLv3), self-hostable
- Behavioral signals from actual product usage, not arbitrary lead scores
- Multi-destination routing: one signal to many tools simultaneously
- No data hoarding: reads events and routes signals without storing product data

## Pricing

- Self-Hosted: Free (bring your own LLM API key)
- Cloud: $0.50/tracked user/month
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Beton exposes itself as an MCP tool server. AI coding agents can call Beton to handle revenue ops tasks — signal detection, CRM routing, lead scoring. Full MCP documentation: https://www.getbeton.ai/mcp.md

Available MCP tools:
- `beton_check_signals` — Detect new revenue signals from product usage
- `beton_score_leads` — Score and qualify leads by account domain
- `beton_route_signal` — Route signals to CRM, Slack, or webhooks
- `beton_analyze_account` — Analyze account behavioral patterns
- `beton_list_signals` — Query signal history with filters
